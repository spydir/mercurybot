# mercurybot

Mercurybot is a concept of creating a customizable game bot to help collect achievements on simple steam games. The first game we're experimenting with is FTL (Faster than Light) because it has several simplistic problems like basic image recognition, hot keys, and mouse interactions. FTL will also require several more complex solution like implementing a machine learning approach to image recognition,  jump-route optimization, effective combat, and gearing up your ship and crew.

As far as my personal ambitions with this project they're based around two factors: Python 2 is hitting end of life in January 2020 so I need to become familiar with Python 3. Additionally, we will be starting on some machine learning projects at work soon and I need some practical experience, however small.

Mercurybot, is fun learning exercise and both my first python 3 project and my first machine learning project. Bug reports and pull requests are welcome, if you can figure out how to actually make it work...  


##### Problem Statement:

For the completionists among us, we feel driven to collect all achievements in our games - especially the simple ones. In order to do this, it generally means was must play the same simple games over-and-over, far beyond their entertainment and replayability thresholds. 


##### Problem Solving Approach:

How do we build a bot that can repeatedly win FTL?
 
 [-] Repeatedly start new games
 [-] Effectively determine jump routes (Avoid the Rebels)
 [-] Successfully win combats
 [-] Effectively deploy crew
 [-] Effectively outfit ship
 [-] Win final fight against boss
 [-] Enable Logging
 [-] Track game statistics 

##### Possible Future Games:

- Papers, Please
- Titan Attacks
- Ultratron 
- Infested Planet
- Into the Breach
- Darkest Dungeon (This is currently my end goal)


## Getting Started

This is very much a work in progress at this point, it works on one of my Macs but not the others. There are some resolution issues in the pyautogui library for retina displays. Once these items are accounted for, I'll create a better how-to
